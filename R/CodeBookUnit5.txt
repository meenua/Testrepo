This document describes the code inside Unit5Assignment.Rmd

The code is splitted (by comments) in some sections:

    Objects
    Loading data
    Manipulating data
    Writing final data to CSV

Objects

data.frane objects like y2015, y2016 used in the code.


Loading data

Loads data from y2015, y2016 dataset to two data.frame respectively. These file is a series of popular children’s names born in the year 2016 and 2015 in the United States.
It consists of three columns with a first name, a gender, and the amount of children given that name.
The returned data.frame contains a column First Name, a column Gender and the column Number of Children from data.
    
Manipulating data
	
	Finds and deletes the entry which had a name misspelled with 'yyy' from y2016
    Merges y2016 with y2015 on first name and gender into a new data frane called 'final'
    Creates a new column 'Total' in 'final'. This column contains the addition of 'number of children' in y2015 and y2016 together
	
	At this point the final data frame  looks like this
	
> head(final)	
	
	FirstName Gender NumberofChildren TotalChildren Total

6     Aaden      M              194           297   491
	
	Sorts 'final' on 'total'
	Displays the top 10 most popular names

10682  Isabella      F            14722         15574 30296
